<p>To start, web development largely involves the creation and modifications of elements of a web site.
<!--ol initiates an unordered list. ol initiates an ordered list.-->
<ul>
    <!--li represents a list element. they have been provided with a 'class' attribute, which allows us to easily select them later
    (in this case, they get selected in the styling file styling.css to make them italic)-->
    <li class="info">HTML is necessary for defining the general structure of a site.</li>
    <li class="info">JavaScript is the most common way to introduce interactivity & general programming capability to websites.</li>
    <li class="info">CSS is the most common way to style websites and to introduce user-friendliness across any type of device. While it is useful, styling will be considered genrally ancillary to our goals in web development and will be mostly ignored.</li>
</ul>
<!--the 'id' attribute allows for CSS and Javascript files to easily select this element. In this case, it is selected
by the styling file to make it bold.)-->
<p id = "objective">Our real objective is to understand the flow of web development enough to prepare you to work with advanced JavaScript frameworks.
The most natural place to start is going to be to write some of your own elements: check out homepage.html, create the elements defined there, and open the html files in your web browser to see your progress.</p>
